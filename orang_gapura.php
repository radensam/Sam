subyek : My Personal Account Was Hacked

......


Hello sir, My Facebook account has been hacked. 

When i try to login its showing me that the password is incorrect and its changed. Then I also tried forget password. But the hacker has also changed the phone number and email from the account. That's why I tottaly lost my access. That's why Iam sending my identity to proof that I am real owner of this account. Please di something about it.
